# Discrete Choice Analysis: micro-econometrics and machine learning approaches (Days 3 and 4)


## General aim
Discrete choice analysis (DCA) has become one of the most important frameworks for transportation modelling. Using DCA, the researcher or analyst is able to estimate the influence of all sorts of factors on travel choice behavior, and to predict mobility patterns and market shares for transport-related services; all this, in a quantitative, statistically rigorous way with deep roots in economics and the behavioral sciences. As such, DCA is indispensable for the underpinning of many transport policies and plans.

In this course, we will cover two different perspectives on DCA: the conventional, econometrics-based perspective (also called Discrete choice theory); and a more novel perspective which is gaining ground rapidly, based on recent advances in Machine learning. This combination makes this course unique, compared to other choice modelling courses taught in the Transport community.

This course will contain a mix of theory, implementation guidelines, and hands-on exercises to be completed during the course and under supervision of the lecturer.
