    "In this lab session we will use ANN to predict mode choice behaviour. Being able to predict model choice behaviour is highly policy relevant. Policy makers use it to develop policies aimed at reducing externalities associated with travel behaviour, such as e.g. fuel levies, subsidization of public transport, speed limits. Additionally, they use it for planning transport infrastructure. Based on travel demand forecast e.g. roads are widened or new train connections are built. Traditionally, mode choice predictions are based on classic econometric tools. Recently, the high prediction performance of ML methods appeal researchs to use ML for model choice predictions too.

The GridSearchCV function in `sk-learn` automates the hyperparemeter tuning process. When tuning the hyperparameters, it is mandatory to use a k-fold cross validation approach.
